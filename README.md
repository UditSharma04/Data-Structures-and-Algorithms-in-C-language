# Data Structures
**This repository contains basic concepts of DSA that I have learned but the whole codes will be writtend in C Language**

## Structures I have learned in theory

- Arrays and ArrayLists
- Linked Lists (Basic , Circular , Doubely Linked List)
- Stack (Basic , using Linked List)
- Queue (Basic , Circular , using Linked List)
- Trees

## Structures I have implemented in code

- Linked List (Traversal and Insertion)
- Stack (Basic)
- Queue (Basic)
